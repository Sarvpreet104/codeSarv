## Hello, World!

Make a new file **first-program.py** and write this code and execute the file.

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

This will display **Hello, World!** on terminal. Congrats you have successfully made your first program in Python.

## Code explaination

**print()** is a built-in function that is used to print anything on terminal. _*(We will see more about function later in the course)*_

Here we had printed a string (the group of characters enclosed in quotes) **"Hello, World!"**.

## Exercise

Here's an exercise for you. Try printing your own name in terminal using **print()** function.

Like I do:

```python
print("codeSarv")
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we had wrote our first python program successfully.

We used a built-in function (function provided by language) **print()** to display a **string** (sequence of characters in quotes '' or ""). You will see the use of **print()** and **strings** in future tutorials too.
